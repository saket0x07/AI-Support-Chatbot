# Microsoft Teams Notifications

## Overview
This official CloudFlow knowledge base article provides an in-depth reference for **Microsoft Teams Notifications**. CloudFlow is a next-generation workflow orchestration and data routing platform designed for cloud-native businesses. Handling integrations tasks securely and efficiently is a fundamental requirement of our systems. Whether you are configuring these policies in the web management dashboard or calling them programmatically via our API layer, this guide covers all relevant configuration steps, security validation details, and execution logic.

Specifically, this module manages the following requirements: Configuring incoming connectors to post automation details into Microsoft Teams.. Under standard operations, these mechanisms are monitored for response latency, throughput, and error rates using our system telemetry engine. Administrators and developer profiles should read the permissions guidelines below to ensure proper authorization credentials.

## Deep Technical Insights
### Webhook Security & Signatures Verification
Integrations calling external webhooks require validation checks to verify authenticity. CloudFlow signs every outgoing payload using HMAC-SHA256 protocols. The hash is computed using the webhook secret key and sent in the header as `X-CloudFlow-Signature`. Target servers should calculate the hash locally and match it with the header to block malicious spoofing.

### Delivery Retries & Backoff Scheduling
Webhook events are delivered asynchronously using our job queues. If the receiving client server is offline or fails with a non-200 code, we retry delivery 5 times using exponential backoff with random jitter. The timeline increments at intervals of 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, and 6h. If all retries fail, the event is logged as failed in the developer console grid.

### Sample Outgoing Payload JSON
```json
{
  "event": "workflow.run.completed",
  "timestamp": "2026-06-16T14:40:00Z",
  "workspace_id": "ws_998877",
  "data": {
    "run_id": "run_abc123",
    "status": "success",
    "execution_time_ms": 124,
    "output_payload": {"status_code": 200, "items_synced": 15}
  }
}
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Open channel settings inside Microsoft Teams.** - Open channel settings inside Microsoft Teams.
2. **Select Connectors and configure an Incoming Webhook card.** - Select Connectors and configure an Incoming Webhook card.
3. **Copy target webhook URL.** - Copy target webhook URL.
4. **Bind webhook target to your CloudFlow notifications step.** - Bind webhook target to your CloudFlow notifications step.

## Edge Cases & Advanced Configurations
Under standard operational paradigms, the CloudFlow pipeline handles concurrency gracefully. However, developers should design integration flows to handle extreme scenarios, such as network partitions, rate limit headers exceeding plan boundaries, or credentials revocation mid-run. If a run is stuck or encounters infinite loop thresholds (more than 100 consecutive loops), the monitoring engine automatically terminates the execution run, raising error code `ERR_LOOP_DETECTED`. For transactions, always utilize `Idempotency-Key` headers when retrying API POST requests to prevent creating duplicate invoices or database rows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I format layouts as Adaptive Cards?
**A**: Yes, we support Microsoft Adaptive Cards schema blocks in Teams notification steps.
