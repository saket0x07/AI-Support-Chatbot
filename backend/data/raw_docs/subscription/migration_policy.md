# Workspace Migration Policies

## Overview
This official CloudFlow knowledge base article provides an in-depth reference for **Workspace Migration Policies**. CloudFlow is a next-generation workflow orchestration and data routing platform designed for cloud-native businesses. Handling subscription tasks securely and efficiently is a fundamental requirement of our systems. Whether you are configuring these policies in the web management dashboard or calling them programmatically via our API layer, this guide covers all relevant configuration steps, security validation details, and execution logic.

Specifically, this module manages the following requirements: Transferring complete account ownership, database integrations, and workflows to different domains.. Under standard operations, these mechanisms are monitored for response latency, throughput, and error rates using our system telemetry engine. Administrators and developer profiles should read the permissions guidelines below to ensure proper authorization credentials.

## Deep Technical Insights
### Subscription Tiers & Scale Limits
CloudFlow structures subscription tiers to balance resource limits and run quotas for teams of different sizes. Starter packages are ideal for simple automation, while Professional and Enterprise tiers scale to high-volume corporate tasks.

### Dynamic Seat Allocation System
Workspace seat management operates on a concurrent user allocation model. Adding a new user seat invites a colleague to register their credentials, immediately updating the active team directory list. If the team size exceeds active subscription allocations, the billing layer appends the new seat unit price ($15/seat/month) to the pending billing cart. Removing an active seat releases the allocated resource, returning it to the pool of unused seats. A seat can be deleted completely from the console settings to decrease recurring base subscription fees permanently.

### Detailed Plan Quotas Breakdown
| Limit Type | Starter Plan | Professional Plan | Enterprise Plan |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Active Workflows | Max 10 flows | Unlimited | Unlimited (Dedicated Runs) |
| Monthly Executions | 1,000 runs | 50,000 runs | Custom (Multi-million capacity) |
| Data Retention Log | 7 days logs | 90 days logs | 7 years logs (Audit Compliant) |
| Concurrency Limit | 2 concurrent runs | 10 concurrent runs | 50+ concurrent runs (Scalable) |

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Log in as Owner and go to Account > Transfer Ownership.** - Log in as Owner and go to Account > Transfer Ownership.
2. **Input the email of the target user.** - Input the email of the target user.
3. **Confirm security transfer checks via email.** - Confirm security transfer checks via email.
4. **The recipient must accept the invitation to complete the migration.** - The recipient must accept the invitation to complete the migration.

## Edge Cases & Advanced Configurations
Under standard operational paradigms, the CloudFlow pipeline handles concurrency gracefully. However, developers should design integration flows to handle extreme scenarios, such as network partitions, rate limit headers exceeding plan boundaries, or credentials revocation mid-run. If a run is stuck or encounters infinite loop thresholds (more than 100 consecutive loops), the monitoring engine automatically terminates the execution run, raising error code `ERR_LOOP_DETECTED`. For transactions, always utilize `Idempotency-Key` headers when retrying API POST requests to prevent creating duplicate invoices or database rows.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Are credit cards transferred?
**A**: No, the new owner must register their card details to prevent service disruption.
